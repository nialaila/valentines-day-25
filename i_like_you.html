        <p>Dear Benjamin, <br><br> First off, I want to say that I really hope you like this little webpage I made. I randomly got the idea and thought it would be cool to do. Secondly, I want to say how glad I am that you have come into my life. I know I have said this before, but I really have never liked anyone the way I like you. You are such an amazing person, and I am grateful to have the privilege to know you (and I can't wait to learn more and more about you).<br><br> I have always hated Valentine's Day, and hoesntly it is only because I have never had anyone to celebrate it with, so I am glad I have you now, not only to celebrate it lol, but just in general. No one makes me laugh the way you do, no one makes me smile the way you do, and no one makes me feel the way you do. I am glad you are mine and that I am yours, and I hope this is the first of many Valentine's we celebrate together. <br><br> p.s. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1dvrcqlQgI">this song</a> makes me think of you!</p>
